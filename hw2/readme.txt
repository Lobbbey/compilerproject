# Homework 2: Lexical Analyzer

## Description
A file is passed, via command line, and is then read and stored into an array. After being read the array is
compared to a list of reserved words and assigned values based on the information at time of parsing.A struct,
named lexemeInfo, is used to hold all of the information that has been parsed. Once the parsing is
completed two functions are called to print the lexeme table and the token list.
